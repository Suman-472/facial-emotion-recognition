# facial-emotion-recognition
This project implements real-time facial emotion recognition using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The system classifies emotions on human faces into one of seven categories (angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, surprise) by training a convolutional neural network (CNN) and deploying it for live webcam detection.
